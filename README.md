# Solution for the problems in Advent of code year 2023

The site [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) creates each year a series of codding challenges.

The problems are released one per day from December 1st to December 25th. Hence the name [Advent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent) of code. For the year 2023 you can find the problems [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Each problem normally consists of two parts that are related. You need to solve the first part to unlock the second one.
Typically, the second is a generalization of the first. So, if you solve the first in a good enough way; the second one should be almost immediately.

Having said that, frequently, when I reach the second part; I realize that my solution was not general enough and I end up spending almost equal time on each part.

For each part of the problem you get a small _test_ input, for which the answer of each test case is provided (as part of the problem statement) and a large text file with the _actual_ input.
The answer for each part is one number.

The input is actually a large text file that contains many test cases.
The final answer is some aggregation of the answer of each test case on the file.
Hence is better to be sure that your program solves the _test_ input before running against the _actual_ input.
Finally, the _actual_ input is usually the same for _both_ parts of the problem.

For this reason the program expects the path for a text file as a parameter and provides a single number as _output_.
I am also versioning the corresponding inputs for each problem and the test inputs for each part.
